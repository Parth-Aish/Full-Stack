TOPIC 4 - WORKING WITH SEQUENCE DATA
Sequence Data
Sequence data refers to a type of data where the order of elements matters. 
This could include time-series data, DNA sequences, text data, etc. 
Understanding and analysing sequence data is crucial in various fields such as finance, genomics, natural language processing, etc.

Using Cross-Record Functions
Cross-record functions involve operations that span multiple records or observations in a dataset. These functions allow you to compute aggregate values or perform calculations across different records. 
For example, calculating the average sales across multiple regions or finding the maximum temperature recorded over a period of time involves using cross-record functions.

Deriving A Counter Field
Deriving a counter field involves creating a new variable or column in a dataset that counts occurrences or events. 
This can be useful for various purposes such as tracking the frequency of certain activities, identifying trends, or measuring performance metrics.
For instance, in a customer database, you might create a counter field to keep track of the number of purchases made by each customer.

Restructuring Data
Restructuring data involves transforming the format or layout of a dataset to make it more suitable for analysis or visualization. 
This may include tasks such as reshaping data from wide to long format or vice versa, pivoting columns into rows, or splitting and merging datasets.
For example, restructuring data from a spreadsheet where each column represents a month's sales into a format where each row represents a single sale transaction can make it easier to analyze sales trends over time.

Geospatial and Time Data
Geospatial and time data involve information related to geographic locations and timestamps.
 Analyzing geospatial and time data can provide insights into patterns, trends, and relationships that are dependent on both spatial and temporal dimensions. 
Real-time examples include tracking the movement of vehicles using GPS data to optimize delivery routes, or analyzing the spread of diseases over time and space to understand epidemiological patterns.
