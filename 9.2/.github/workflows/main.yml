# --- Jobs ---
# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs
jobs:
  # Job 1: Build the React application
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out your repository code
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js (version 18)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          # Use npm caching to speed up 'npm ci'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      # Use 'npm ci' for faster, more reliable installs in CI
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run tests
      # create-react-app automatically runs tests once (not watch)
      # when it detects a CI environment.
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        env:
          CI: true

      # Step 5: Build the project for production
      # This uses the 'homepage' field in package.json to set paths
      - name: Build the project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 6: Upload the build artifacts
      # This prepares the 'build' folder for the 'deploy' job
      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          # This is the default build folder for create-react-app
          path: ./build

  # Job 2: Deploy the built app to GitHub Pages
  deploy:
    # This job depends on the 'build' job completing successfully
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Configure the environment for GitHub Pages
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      # This will output the URL of the deployed page
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}

    steps:
      # Step 1: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment # Give the step an ID to reference its output
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
        # This action automatically finds the artifact from the 'build' job
